A bug tracker with a web-based user interface, similar to Jira and Bugzilla. This repository is the web client built with Angular.

The corresponding REST web service source code is [available here](https://github.com/kkazm/bugtracker).

**Demo available online at <https://kkazm.ovh/bugtracker>**

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
